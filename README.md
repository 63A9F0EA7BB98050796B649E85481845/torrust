# Torrust

## Project Description

***Torrust is a suite of client-server software for hosting online torrent indexes.***

### Need

With various online torrent indexes being taken down (such as THE PIRATE BAY and KICKASSTORRENTS), the need for online torrent indexes is ever growing.
There is also a need for private torrent indexes. The problem with public torrent indexes is that the quality of the hosted torrents will not be assured.

### Approach

We will develop a BitTorrent tracker with a private and public tracker option and a webapplication for uploading and downloading torrents that are being tracked by the BitTorrent tracker.

### Benefit

Anyone will be able to host their own (private) BitTorrent tracker and online torrent index with ease.
